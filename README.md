# Get universal link to any of your file using the UUID-scheme

Create permanent links to any file on your Mac so you never have dead links in your notes (or any other place you want to have URI references).

## Installation

In a terminal :

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cglacet/uuid-scheme/master/install.sh)"
```

## Example of usage

Find the file you want to reference and copy a link to it (either markdown, or plain text link): 
<div align="center"><img src="img/copy_link.png" width=600/></div>

Then paste it anywhere, say for example in your prefered note editor (I love Bear, but feel free to love another one ðŸ˜„): 
<div align="center"><img src="img/paste_and_open.png" width=750/></div>
